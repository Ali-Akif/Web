      <h1>Interneting Is Easy!</h1>
      <p>First, we need to learn some basic HTML.</p>

      <h2>Headings</h2>
      <p>Headings define the otline of your site. There are six levels of headings.</p>

      <h2>Lists</h2>
      <p>This is how you make an unordored list:</p>
      <ul>
         <li>Add a "ul" element (it stands for unordored list)</li>
         <li>Add each item in its own "li" element</li>
         <li>They don't need to be in any particular order</li>
         <li><p>You can add a "p" inside a "li"</p></li>
      </ul>

      <p>This is what an ordered list looks like:</p>
      <ol>
         <li>Notice the new "ol" element wrapping everything</li>
         <li>But, the list iteem elements are the same</li>
         <li>Also note how the numbers increment on their own</li>
         <li>You should be noticing things is this precise order, because this is an ordered list</li>
      </ol>

      <p>The <em>"em"</em> stands for <em>Emphasis</em>, because sometimes, you need to draw attention to a particular word or phrase.</p>
      <p>Other times you need to <em><strong>strong</strong></em>ly <em><strong>em</strong></em>phasize the importance of a word or phrase.</p>

      <p>Regards, <br>
