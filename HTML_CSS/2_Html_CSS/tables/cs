All Table Related Attributes
Attribute	    Element(s) Found On	                    What it does
colspan	        th, td	                                extends a cell to be as wide as 2 or more cells
rowspan	        th, td	                                extends a cell to be as tall as 2 or more cells
span	        col	                                    Makes the column apply to more to 2 or more columns
sortable	    table	                                Indicates the table should allow sorting. UPDATE: I’m told this was removed from spec because of lack of implementations.

headers	        td	                                    space-separated string corresponding to ID’s of the <th> elements relevant to the data
scope	        th	                                    row | col | rowgroup | colgroup (default) – essentially specifies the axis of the header. The default is that a header is heading a column, which is typical, but a row might start with a header also, where you would scope that header to the row or rowgroup.
