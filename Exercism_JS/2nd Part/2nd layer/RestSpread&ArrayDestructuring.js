// Rest
// When ... appears on the left-hand side of an assignment, those three dots are known as the rest operator. The three dots together with a variable name is called a rest element. It collects zero or more values, and stores them into a single array.

// Spread
// When ... appears on the right-hand side of an ASSIGNEMENT, it's known as the spread operator. It expands an array into a list of elements. Unlike the rest element, it can appear anywhere in an array literal expression, and there can be more than one.
